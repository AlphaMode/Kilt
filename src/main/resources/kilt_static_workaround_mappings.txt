# so. i just realized my workaround for static doesn't actually work.
# but now i know how ASM works. so let's just make mappings from MC classes
# to Kilt mixin interfaces.

# the format here is very similar to Tiny, but this isn't Tiny.
# The purpose of this file is to provide a specific list of statics that it should be remapping,
# not remapping the entire class.

# mc remaps the whole class.
