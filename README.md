# Kilt
A Fabric mod that brings Forge mods into the Fabric ecosystem. Very experimental.

## FAQ (probably)
### Why?
I like Fabric. And I hate Forge.

### No, but like, doesn't Patchwork exist?
Patchwork has been in development for over 2 years, and I essentially got tired of waiting.
The source code that's currently being worked on isn't even available to the public!

### Okay... so how does this work?
So, instead of just bringing FML into Fabric, this essentially
reimplements most of Forge's APIs by doing it in its own way, and
then translating it into a Forge API call.

### How have you not lost your sanity doing this?
Already have. Next question.
