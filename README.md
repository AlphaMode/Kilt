# Kilt
A Fabric mod that brings Forge mods into the Fabric ecosystem. Very experimental.

## FAQ (probably)
### Why?
I like Fabric. And I hate Forge. More reasons [here](WHY.md).

### No, but like, doesn't Patchwork exist?
Patchwork has been in development for over 2 years, and I essentially got tired of waiting.
The source code that's currently being worked on isn't even available to the public yet!

### Okay... so how does this work?
Basically this recreates FML in its own way, with some of its own changes
to hopefully improve on its performance, and sometimes also using
native Fabric-provided APIs for compatibility.

### How have you not lost your sanity doing this?
Already have. Next question.

## Credits & Acknowledgements
I want to give a huge amount of thanks to the [Fabricators of Create](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create)
for making [Porting Lib](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Porting-Lib),
as without it, this would have been significantly harder to do.

Thank you to the [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) developers, [cpw](https://github.com/cpw) and [LexManos](https://github.com/LexManos), and all of its contributors,
for making the Forge API, and having it open-sourced.

Thank you to the [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net) developers, [modmuss50](https://github.com/modmuss50), [sfPlayer1](https://github.com/sfPlayer1), and [asiekierka](https://github.com/asiekierka), for
creating Fabric.

And thank you to my friend [Zuite](https://twitter.com/Zuite_), for being the wall that I
throw all my code frustrations and thought processes at, as
she has helped me tremendously to just stop and think about all of the
problems at hand.
