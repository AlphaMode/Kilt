# Updating Kilt (for developers)
Leaving this for myself in case I forget.

## New Versions of Minecraft
First off, UPDATE src/main/resources/joined.tsrg. You can get it from here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/de/oceanlabs/mcp/mcp_config/index.html
Eventually, this would be improved to just download MCPConfig dynamically, but
I'm not smart with Gradle pfft.
