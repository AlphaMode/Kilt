# Why?
## Why did you even make Kilt? How did this even start?

On the 29th of December 2022, my friend Kiran had asked me to port 
a long list of Forge mods over to Fabric. I had thought to myself,
"Why port this many mods for only a few people to play it, and if no
one else is going to use it except for us?"

Then it had hit me. Forge, in Fabric, for everyone to use.
Running Fabric in Forge would've been impossible, I believe,
because of how early Fabric loads everything in comparison to Forge.

This mod would solve so many problems with people having to
find Fabric-compatible versions of their favourite mods,
the struggles of having to drop their favourite Forge mods
just because it was unavailable for Fabric.

I had attempted to do this already, twice, actually. But I never
came close to even properly starting. Eventually, I finally
created the project. **Kilt**, would be the name of it. 
The project I would dedicate myself towards until the day
I die. Something I can look back upon and think "Wow, I'm proud
of myself for this."

This is my love letter to Minecraft,
the game that has raised me to who I am now, since I was 5.
My gift to the community, born from my love of Fabric, and
my hatred of Forge.

Yet, this is also my thank you to Forge, for having raised
the modding community that there is today. For all the
wonderful memories I had with it when I was younger,
such as when I was a kid, watching the Yogscast's
Tekkit Classic and MoonQuest series. I had grown more
interested in technology because of all the tech mods made
in Forge.

All my love for programming, poured into this one mod.
